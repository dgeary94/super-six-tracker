# Super Six League Tracker

_Super Six League Tracker_ is a data visualisation project which plots data
from a Sky Sports _Super Six_ league into an interactive graph using D3.js. The data is stored in a csv file in the src directory. The graph features a toggleable legend for showing/hiding different players. In addition, it features a basic statistics table presenting the best round, average round, and standard deviation, correct results and correct scores for each player.
