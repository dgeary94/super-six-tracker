# Super Six League Tracker

*Super Six League Tracker* is a personal data visualisation project which plots scores
from a Sky Sports *Super Six* league into an interactive graph using D3.js. The data is stored in a csv file in the route directory. The graph features a toggleable legend for showing/hiding different players. In addition, it features a basic statistics table presenting the best round, average round, and standard deviation for each player.
